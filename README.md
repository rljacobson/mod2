# `mod2-lib`: A pattern matching and term rewriting library

- The [`mod2-lib`](mod2-lib/README.md) library builds on lessons learned in previous experiments to bring advanced pattern matching algorithms 
  to Rust.

- The [`mod2`](mod2/README.md) crate is a small Maude-like language meant to exercise the algorithms in `mod2-lib` and stand as a thorough
  example of how to use `mod2-lib`.

- The [`mod2-abs`](mod2-abs/README.md) crate is an abstraction layer over backend implementations of various generally useful utilities used 
  throughout.

This project is a work in progress. For a more complete work, check out [Loris](https://github.com/rljacobson/loris).
